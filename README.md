# Harvard Math PhD Qualifying Exam Notes

This is a set of notes prepared while studying for the mathematics qualifying examination at Harvard University. The material appearing on the exam consists of six subjects: real analysis, complex analysis, algebra, algebraic topology, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. A typical exam consists of three 3-hour papers, each containing one problem from each of the six sections. For more details regarding the format of the qualifying exam, please see [this page](https://www.math.harvard.edu/graduate/study-the-qualifying-exam/).

This repository continues work begun by Atanas [here](https://github.com/thenasko/study-guide), as I felt a lot of results were missing here and it could use some polishing. In producing the 6 TeX documents in this repo (one for each of the six subjects as above), we have used purely a subset of the sources advised by Harvard [here](https://www.math.harvard.edu/graduate/study-the-qualifying-exam/the-qualifying-exam-syllabus/). The purpose of this repo is to provide the student with all the necessary knowledge, centralised, in the sense that they know every single definition and theorem concerning each of the 6 subjects. Harvard has plentiful past papers available [here](https://www.math.harvard.edu/graduate/study-the-qualifying-exam/some-old-qualifying-exams/) which are very useful to study in conjunction with these notes.

Please note, this was an independent project undertaken at the end of 2025 to collaborate all of the 'knowledge base' theoretically necessary to attempt the qualifying exam. I am not and have not been a student at Harvard, but rather a student studying Maths at a British university, and was struck by the breadth required by these exams which one doesn't naturally attain coverage of under the UK system (unless you choose units in a very peculiar way), hence I was intrigued to expand my knowledge.
